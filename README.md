To provide a comprehensive learning environment for users to understand climate science, impacts, and solutions.



The Interactive Climate Education Platform aims to provide a comprehensive learning environment for users to better understand climate science, its impacts, and the solutions available. The platform will include a range of educational content such as articles, videos, quizzes, and infographics. It will feature simulations of the greenhouse effect, carbon footprint calculators, and interactive maps displaying the impact of climate change on different regions. This project seeks to educate users on the scientific concepts underlying climate change and empower them with the knowledge to take action.


The platform will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and interactive user experience. WordPress will be used as the content management system, allowing easy updates to educational content, such as articles, videos, and quizzes. This system will also support dynamic content generation and management. Interactive features like quizzes, simulations, and calculators will provide a hands-on learning experience. By integrating APIs and third-party tools, the platform will offer real-time data updates and personalized content for users, making it a valuable resource for understanding climate science and its global impact.
